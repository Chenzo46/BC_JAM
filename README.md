<h1> What the Heck is this Game About????? </h1>
Glad you asked, this game has you playing as Jango the cat, a stoic black cat that fell down a deep sinkhole and is on his journey to get back to the surface. On his way up he encounters platforming challenges, interesting obstacles, and... other cats?
Turns out he's not the only one who's trapped at the bottom of the sinkhole, these cats have even established their own little homestead, and they're probably happier than the cats on the surface. Nonetheless, through helping other cats you find along the way, solving
puzzles, and completing platforming challenges, Jango can find his way to the top and get back home.

<h1> Why the heck was this game made </h1>
This game started out as an entry to the <a href = "https://itch.io/jam/black-cat-jam-1">Black Cat Jam</a> but spiraled into a bigger idea as the prospect of adding a story and making a more "complete" game came to mind. I want to publish this game on steam as my first
full game, and I think there is a lot to learn from creating a feature-complete game that can't be learned from small jam projects and prototypes. I've already learned a lot and there is still definitely a lot more to learn and implement as this project grows bigger.
